# lua-vehicle-clamp
A custom vehicle clamp (wheel lock) system for ESX-based FiveM servers. This script allows authorized jobs (e.g. police) to apply or remove wheel clamps from vehicles based on license plates. Clamped vehicles cannot be driven and will show a visual clamp prop. Includes full Discord logging and permission control.
